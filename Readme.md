# Deploy Branch (feat-deploy) - Work in Progress
Important: This branch is solely dedicated to deploying the application. It is currently a work in progress 
and not yet finalized.

## Overview
This branch is configured for deployment using Render and leverages AWS S3 for storing the YOLOv8 model file. 
The goal is to ensure the application runs smoothly on Render's platform while managing large model files 
efficiently with AWS S3.

## Current Issues
At the moment, there are issues with downloading videos from YouTube due to permission restrictions. Specifically, 
the application encounters errors related to YouTube's bot protection, leading to difficulties in video downloads. 
This is an ongoing challenge that needs to be addressed.
